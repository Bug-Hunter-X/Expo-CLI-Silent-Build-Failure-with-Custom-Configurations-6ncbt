The solution involves a systematic approach to identifying and resolving the conflict. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Dependency Audit:** Carefully review your `package.json` file and examine each dependency. Look for dependencies that might conflict with Expo's build process or introduce their own bundling mechanisms.
2. **Conflict Resolution:** If you identify conflicting dependencies, consider the following options:
   * **Removal:** Remove the conflicting dependency if it's not crucial to your application's functionality. This is often the simplest solution.
   * **Version Change:** Update the conflicting dependency to a version that's compatible with Expo. Consult the package's documentation for compatible Expo versions.
   * **Selective Inclusion:** If the conflict is related to specific files or modules, you might be able to exclude them from the Expo build process through configuration options.
3. **Configuration Review:** Review the project's configuration files (like `expo.json`, `app.json`, or custom build scripts). Ensure that no custom configurations are interfering with Expo's default build process.
4. **Clean Build:** After making changes, perform a clean build to ensure that previous build artifacts or cache don't interfere. This often involves deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.
5. **Gradual Integration:** If introducing new native modules, integrate them gradually. Add one module at a time, testing after each addition to isolate the source of any conflicts.
