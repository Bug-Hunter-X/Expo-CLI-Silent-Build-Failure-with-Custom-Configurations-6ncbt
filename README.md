# Expo CLI Silent Build Failure with Custom Configurations

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where the build process fails silently or with unclear error messages when a project uses custom build configurations or has dependencies that conflict with Expo's build system.

The error is particularly difficult to debug because it doesn't provide specific details about the cause of the failure. This can occur when integrating native modules or modifying the standard Expo build setup.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. The build process will likely fail without providing clear error messages.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the project's dependencies and build configurations to identify and resolve any conflicts.  The solution file shows an example of resolving this by identifying and removing conflicting packages or modifying the configuration to be compatible with Expo's build process.
