This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that uses a custom build process, especially when the project has dependencies that conflict with Expo's build process.  The build process may fail silently or show ambiguous errors, making it difficult to pinpoint the source of the problem. This often arises when integrating native modules or modifying the underlying build system beyond Expo's standard configurations. For example, if a dependency attempts to use a different bundler than Metro, it might cause this issue.
